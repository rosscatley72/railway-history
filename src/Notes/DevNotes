Step 3 - Look at how to build authorisation capabilty to enable route editing per user
1. Pass icon back to Sidebar
2. Graft side bar onto map
3. Sort design of editing page

Editing

Step 1 - Design Edit UI

Add Route - Info panel on right (route name, opening date, status history), first click start of line, second click end of line, 
MVP only add route with terminus at both ends - day 1 click onto existing line and add junction
Display line.
Clicking on line adds a routepoint
Routepoint can be dragged on map, to move route into position.
Clicking on routepoint opens info window - empty day 1 - split into subroutes, add station, add junction next phase





Step 1.1 - Sidebar, what goes here, what goes on info panel?
Step 1.2 - How do you select existing routepoints to (a) move (b) transform - eg change to junction/station (c) delete
Step 1.3 - How do you add a new route point between two existing route points
Step 1.4 - Can you click on a polyline to insert a new route point?



Background tasks

1. Look at font sizes in mobile mode and add adaptive styling
2. Tidy up location of error messages under input boxes on registration page
3. Grey out login button whilst waiting for login to prevent double pressing
4. Handle login errors with red bar under nav rather than console.log
5. Add Forgot and Change password functions (see Cognito tutorial part III for details)
6. Login page - return to page that login button was pressed from
