A route is a raiway line with a defined startpoint and endpoint that routes via muliple routepoints.
Generally a route will be have common characteristics eg ownership - date of opening.
A subroute may be required if for example a line was opened and closed in stages (eg diffent dates)
or has seen a diversion at a point in time.
A (sub) route will start and end either at a terminus station, or a junction.

A (sub) route will have at least one status and a date that status occured, and one or more opening dates (more than one if a line was closed and reopened)
and may have one or more closing date, along with at least one owner and at least one operator and a date that
each owner and operator started owning/operating the (sub) route.

Statuses

1. Open
2. Closed
3. Open to Goods Traffic
4. Mothballed

A junction is a join between different routes OR a crossing between tracks on a route.

Overlays include: Stations, Goods Depots, Signal Boxes, Viaducts, Engine Sheds etc - groups of railway types with common characteristics at a geographic location (MVP = stations only)

Routes and Overlays can have assets attached to them that include - photos, videos, websites, Facebook groups, books.
Where applicable, assets can have dates attached to them, to allow relevant assets to be shown against the time slider.

The time slider sets a point in time on the map to show how the railways looked at that point in time.
